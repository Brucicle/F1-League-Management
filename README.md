# F1-League-Management
F1 League Management is an Excel template designed to help F1 2021 league owners track points, penalties, and other league statistics. Below is a summary each page.

**Previews of the spreadsheet can be seen in the "Issues" tab.**

**League Management**

- Where you will enter the league's track list, all participating drivers, and team assignments. 
- Race Director: This shows the next race in the league’s calendar and penalty information for each driver. You can refer to this page before each race to check for bans. 
- League Settings: You can customize aspects of the sheet such as how many points each position will earn drivers, how many points it takes to earn a qualifying and race ban, and other options that personalize your league. 

**Championships**

- Standard championship standings for driver and constructors.

**Results Tables**

- All post-race information that the game offers is entered here. There are four categories that must be filled out for each participating driver. 
  - Qualifying Result
  - Time From Leader
  - Fastest Lap
  - Reserve Team (only for reserve drivers)
- Any league administered penalties including time penalties, penalty points, and bans are entered into each race's corresponding penalties table, located after each race’s results table. 

**Race/Qualifying Results**

- These are separate pages that show each driver's final result in each session.
- Race Results will indicate drivers who earned fastest lap and color-code results by position. 

**Race Reports**

- Automatically filled out each for each race. Consider this the equivalent to the in-game post race results. 
- Below each race report are incident reports. In these tables, you can present league administered penalties and give explanations as to why they were administered. 

**Driver Statistics**

- Various league related statistics for all drivers
